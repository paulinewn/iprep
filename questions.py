Why are web applications slow?
1) Slow client: 
It occurs when a developer processes a lot of data client side
Or when the number/size of external resources are included
Images may not be resized correctly
Decrease modules and components for apps
2) Slow server: 
Sometimes its the servers rather than the network. 
Front end application server talks with application server that talks with middleware server that
queries one or more DB servers
Then all of the serves might talk with DNS servers to look up IP addresses or map them back to 
server names
3) Diminuitve DB:
Apps are released internally with a small data set, but when the DB grows the lack of 
performance optimization is obvious. 
Make the database query more efficiently
4) Slow network
5) Chatty conversations:
See how many requests between systems, where the systems connect to the network, and into the 
delays between requests
